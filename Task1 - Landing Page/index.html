            <h2>Sugarcane fiber is renewable, biodegradable and compostable. Sugarcane fiber is also called sugarcane bagasse or just
            bagasse. Its the fibrous part of a sugarcane stalk thats left over after extracting the juice. Often this part of the
            sugarcane is discarded, incinerated or used as a fuel source for sugar mills.<br>
            
            Transforming sugarcane stalks into products is giving them a new life as raw materials. Because it uses a non-edible
            byproduct of a food production, this material is considered an extremely renewable resource.</h2>

            fertilizers and needs little water. Currently, bamboo fabric is considered to be the trendiest sustainable fabric in the
            fashion world.<br>

            Bamboo plants are capable of growing up to four feet a day. Moreover, bamboo plant releases 35% more oxygen in the air
            compared to other trees of the same size. With its fast growth, bamboo matures within seven years. It does not need to
            be replanted as it has a vast root network that continuously sprouts new shoots. It helps to improve soil condition and
            prevent soil erosion.</h2>

            is the oldest cultivated plant in the world with uses dating back to the stone age. Bits of hemp fabric have been found
            dating back to about 8,000 B.C. revealing the oldest example of human industry. <br>
            
            Hemp production uses significantly less chemicals than cotton which makes it more sustainable and naturally more
            suitable for people with chemical sensitivity. The fiber is completely biodegradable, holds its shape as good as
            polyester but also has breathability.</h2>

<!--PART 5 IMPACT-->
<div class="about">
    <h1><a class="wel">Impact</a></h1>
    <h2>The World Commission on Environment and Development popularized this concept in 1987. Their report defines the idea as a
        “development which meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
        needs.” <br>

        The longer we continue to pursue unsustainable development, the more severe will the consequences be. One of the most
        common is climate change which is being debated widely worldwide.In fact, climate change is already wreaking havoc on
        our surroundings. So, the need of the hour is sustainable development. <br>

        We have sworn to protect our environment by promoting goods, and merchandise that are eco-friendly so that we
        can only promote and make only those products that are reusable and by no means harms our precious environment. <br>
